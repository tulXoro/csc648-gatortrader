# GatorTrader

## Description

This was a team driven project built in the style of an AGILE environment, simulating a small startup. It is an online marketplace similar to [craigslist](craigslist.org/). The website allows users to upload products they want to sell, which will need to be approved by an admin. Other users can contact the seller, where they can discuss how the transaction will proceed.
*This website does not actually process any transactions, and all transactions are done through users*.

## How it works

It runs [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/) on the front end and [Expressjs](https://expressjs.com/) for API routing. Originally, we hosted it on AWS and used [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) as a reverse proxy. It also uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database.

## Usage

Use this however you see fit.

## Installation

*Note: You will need to replicate the SQL schema, which isn't included in the repository.*

1. Clone the repository and change directory into it.
2. Install necessary dependencies with `npm i`.
3. Change directory to the process you want to run *(ig: `application/frontend`)*.
5. Start the app using `npm run dev`.
