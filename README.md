# csc648 Repository

## What is this?
This was a team driven project built in the style of an AGILE environment, simulating a small startup.

## What does the website do?
The website allows users to upload products they want to sell, which will need to be approved by an admin. Other users can contact the seller, where they can discuss how the transaction will proceed.
*This website does not actually process any transactions, and all transactions are done through users*.
